This is a time and task management application based on the Pomodoro technique. The goal is to help users focus on their tasks.

üìå The project is in progress, but it is already functional.

## ‚è∞ What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method created by Francesco Cirillo to improve productivity during work and study. The method divides work time into typically 25-minute intervals dedicated to focusing on a task, followed by short breaks of 5 minutes. After four pomodori, a longer break of around 15 minutes is taken.


## üöÄ How to Use?

1. Add tasks with a name and the estimated number of pomodori you think you will need to complete them. A pomodoro is a 25-minute interval.
2. Select a task.
3. Start the timer.
4. Focus on the task for 25 minutes.
5. When the timer ends, the application automatically switches to the break interval.
6. Repeat the process as many times as needed.


## ‚ú® Features
